# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program

```
x=16
y=bin(x)
print(y)
```

## Output
<img width="326" height="277" alt="438109262-8f430ebe-a612-44ae-9e21-d057296ee0c5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecb634f6-5f2b-4c22-802e-1f164a373b12" />


## Result

Thus,the Python program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions is created successfully.
